One paragraph explanation of the feature.

## Motivation
Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed design
This is the bulk of the proposal. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with the ecosystem to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to write. Include examples of how the feature will be used. This section can start out light before the prototyping phase but should get into specifics and corner-cases as the feature is iteratively designed and implemented.

## Drawbacks & Alternatives
Why shouldn't we do this? What is the impact of not doing this? What other designs have been considered? 

## Unresolved questions
What parts of the design are still undecided?
